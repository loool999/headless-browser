# Headless Browser Research Summary

## Playwright Overview
- Playwright is a powerful browser automation library that supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- It's already installed in our environment (version 1.51.0)
- Provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for Python
- Supports headless mode for all browser types

## Headless Browser Capabilities
- Can run browsers without displaying UI (headless mode)
- Supports full browser automation including navigation, clicking, typing
- Can capture screenshots and handle JavaScript-heavy sites
- Provides access to browser DevTools Protocol (CDP) for advanced control
- Supports multiple browser contexts for isolated sessions

## Headless Mode Options
- Chromium has a dedicated headless shell for better performance
- New headless mode available that's closer to regular headed mode
- Can configure various browser parameters (viewport, device scale, etc.)
- Supports mobile device emulation

## Implementation Approach
- Use Playwright's Python API to create a headless browser service
- Implement a simple web interface to control the headless browser
- Add optimizations for handling complex websites
- Expose the service via a web server for remote access

## Code Example (Basic Usage)
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    # Perform actions, take screenshots, etc.
    browser.close()
```

## Considerations for Implementation
- Need to implement higher frame rate updates for smoother experience
- Enable full interaction capabilities for complex websites
- Handle JavaScript-heavy sites with specialized configurations
- Consider browser-specific optimizations for problematic websites
